I'm an avid reader of blogs and papers. However, I've noticed that I don't really "get" the information. In theory, I can speak about it, but I can't reason about the underlying logic. This is why I've decided to write down my findings in my own words. I've found that writing stuff down in my own words helps retention and understanding.
